Solo Project

Sunny Day is a smart, weather-enabled todo list app that makes it easy for you to take the local weather into account when planning your life!

This project was a very quick two-week sprint from final design to test & deploy and was a lot of fun, allowed me to explore multiple APIs, AI, and new drag-and-drop libraries!


## Features
- Create new lists or copy old lists to use as templates for recurring tasks.
- Fun drag and drop allows you to easily re-organize lists and task items.
- Add a location to any list to see up-to-date weather information at the top of the list.
- Get AI recommendations on when to complete your list items according to the weather!
    - Rainy on Thursday?  You should consider re-sceduling your bike ride to Wednesday!
    - Since the rain is coming on Thursday anyway, you might want to mop the floors then!

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
React, React/Redux, Redux-Sagas, DND-Kit drag and drop library

### Backend 
Node.js, Express, Passport (Auth), PostgreSQL database running on Render, Heroku for host & deploy

### API integrations
Google place & place autocomplete w/tokens, Virtual Crossing for weather information by location, OpenAI chat complete endpoint for recommendations based on current weather and task list items
